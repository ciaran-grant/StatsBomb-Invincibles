# StatsBomb-Invincibles

## Project Overview:
Arsenal's Invincibles season is unique to the Premier League, they are the only team that has gone a complete 38 game season without losing. They're considered to be one of the best teams ever to play in the Premier League. Going a whole season without losing suggests they were at least decent at defending, to reduce or completely remove bad luck from ruining their perfect record. This project aims to look into how Arsenal's defence managed this. To do so training a model is not necessary as this is a descriptive task, not a predictive one. Instead, I will focus on answering the questions with data visualisations to effectively represent and communicate the answers to the questions.

Using StatsBomb's public event data for the Arsenal 03/04 season* (33 games), I take a look at where Arsenal's defensive actions take place and how opponents attempted to progress the ball and create chances against them.

The goal is to identify areas of Arsenal's defensive strengths and the frequent approaches used by opponents. Tasks involved are as follows:

1. Download and preprocess StatsBomb's event data
2. Explore and visualise Arsenal's defensive actions
3. Explore and visualise Opponent's ball progression by thirds
4. Cluster and evaluate Opponent's ball progressions using several clustering methods.
5. Visualise clustering results to aid understanding.
6. Cluster and evaluate Opponent's shot creations using several clustering methods.
7. Visualise clustering results to aid understanding
